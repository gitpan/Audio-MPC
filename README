NAME
    Audio::MPC - Perl extension for decoding musepack-encoded files

SYNOPSIS
        use Audio::MPC;
        use Fcntl qw/:seek/;
    
        my $mpc = Audio::MPC->new("file.mpc") or die Audio::MPC->errstr;
    
        open OUT, ">", "file.wav" or die $!;
        seek OUT, WAV_HEADER_SIZE, SEEK_SET;    # leave space for wave-header
    
        my $total;
        while ((my $num_bytes = $mpc->decode(my $buf)) > 0) {
            $total += $num_bytes;
            print OUT $buf;
        }

        # insert wave-header for $total bytes of data
        seek OUT, 0, SEEK_SET;
        print OUT $mpc->wave_header($total);
        close OUT;
        
DESCRIPTION
    This module is a wrapper around libmpcdec that allows for decoding
    musepack-encoded digital audio.

    libmpcdec is a lossy audio-compression format optimized for higher
    bitrates. See http://www.musepack.net/ for details.

INSTALLATION
    To install this module type the following:

       perl Makefile.PL
       make
       make test
       make install

DEPENDENCIES
    Due to a subtle but unpleasant interaction between C++ method
    overloading and the perl internals, you need at least perl5.8.0.

    You need a working C++ compiler and libmpcdec as avilable from
    http://www.musepack.net/. Furthermore:

        Test::More
        Test::LongString
